# REMINDME 1.0

A project I developed for my university assignment. An Arduino based IoT design to help you remember of your daily essentials! 


### Concept

RemindMe 1.0 was a 3d printed little box with 5 buttons sticking out of it. On the side it had a sonic sensor to detect distance from objects passing by it. 

The entire system was to be hang by the door with the sensor facing the door, and the buttons facing the room. 

The idea was this: When walking out the room, user would be reminded of theirs daily essentials. When walking pass by the distance sensor, then the system would check if the person "checked off" every button on the systems interface. If not the system start to create disturbing sound to remind the user of their forgetfulness! They would go back, check whether they took their daily essentials or not, then check off the buttons assigned to each item, and would out the door peacfully! 

And obviously if they had already checked off every button they;d be able to walk out right of the back!

Here is the block diagram to visualize it all:
